# Restore-Hudson-NFT

Python Resources for NFT creation
  1. Time Lapse technique  2. Video editing - Moviepy 3. Convert to gif 4. OpenCV - color 


The footage captured is segments of the Hudson as the drone moves northwards up the river in 500-1000 meter segments, and these segments will be chronological & geospatially  crunched by the imaging technique into a steady expanding and contracting flow/shape (no sharp/sudden expansions and contractions of the shape of the river - dissolves that make a natural transition from one segment to the next.  
Still unsure about sound - if there is sound it would be nature sounds on the Hudson possibly with some other ambient music
